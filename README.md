# Mars_Compressor

The point of this project provide a majority of the design requirements for a compressor on Mars.
At this time, the following are ideas for investigation:
      *Model of the Martian Atmosphere giving the Temperature, Pressure, Density, and gas composition at the compressor inlet.
      *Model of the dust in the Martian Atmosphere that will need to be filtered out and potential filtration methods.
      *Generative design of the compressor to evolutionarily optimize the compressor.
